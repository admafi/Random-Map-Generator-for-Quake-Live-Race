* Random Map Generator form Quake Live Race

This tool generates very simple rooms in the Quake 3 .map format. It asks for the mapsize, some parameters like ambientlightscale and then fills the map with light-, player-, race-entities and random brushes which you can choose to some extent.
The placement of brushes is not procedural but completely random within the size of the room.
