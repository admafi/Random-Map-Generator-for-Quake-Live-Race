* Random Map Generator for Quake Live Race

This tool generates very simple rooms in the Quake 3 .map format. It asks for the mapsize, some parameters like ambientlightscale and then fills the map with light-, player-, race-entities and random brushes which shape you can choose to some extent.
The placement of brushes is not procedural but completely random within the size of the room. Light entities are placed along the line between race end- and startingpoint.
